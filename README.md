# TigerReddit

A Vibe-coded native Reddit client for Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger, built with Objective-C and Python 3.11. Features image viewing, video downloading, comment browsing, and modern Reddit API support on vintage PowerPC and Intel Macs.


## Features

- üêÖ **Tiger Compatible** - Built specifically for Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger
- üì± **Modern Reddit** - Browse any subreddit with current Reddit API
- üñºÔ∏è **Image Support** - View thumbnails and download full images
- üé• **Video Downloads** - Download videos from Reddit, YouTube, and more
- üí¨ **Comments** - Read post comments with optimized parsing
- üîó **Article Links** - Open external articles in your browser
- üì¶ **Gallery Support** - Handle Reddit image galleries

## System Requirements

- Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger (PowerPC G4/G5)
- GCC 4.0 (included with Xcode 2.5 or Developer Tools)
- Python 3.11
- Internet connection

## Prerequisites

### 1. TenFourFox/Leopard.sh/Tiger.sh Setup

For modern TLS support and package management:

**Option B: leopard.sh (Leopard users)**
```bash
# Install leopard.sh package manager
curl -L https://github.com/leopardsh/leopardsh/raw/main/install.sh | bash
```

**Option C: tiger.sh (Tiger users)**
```bash
# Install tiger.sh package manager  
curl -L https://github.com/tigersh/tigersh/raw/main/install.sh | bash
```

### 2. Python 3.11 Installation

**Using tiger.sh (Recommended):**
```bash
# Install tiger.sh package manager  
curl -L https://github.com/tigersh/tigersh/raw/main/install.sh | bash
tiger.sh install python3.11
```

**Manual Installation:**
```bash
# Download Python 3.11 source from python.org
# Compile with Tiger-compatible flags
./configure --enable-optimizations
make
sudo make install
```

### 3. FFmpeg (for video support)

**Using tiger.sh:**
```bash
tiger.sh install ffmpeg
```

**Manual Installation:**
```bash
# Download and compile FFmpeg from source
# Follow FFmpeg Tiger compilation guides
```

## Building from Source

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/reddit-viewer-tiger.git
cd reddit-viewer-tiger
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Dependencies are automatically downloaded and bundled during the build process. You only need to ensure Python 3.11 is installed on your system.

### 3. Build with Makefile

```bash
# Build for your architecture
make

# Or specify architecture explicitly:
make ARCH=ppc      # For PowerPC
make ARCH=i386     # For Intel (haven't tested)
make ARCH=universal # For Universal Binary (haven't tested)
```

The Makefile will (attempt to) automatically:
- Download cJSON source files
- Download yt-dlp
- Bundle Python scripts into the app
- Create a complete .app bundle

cJSON and yt-dlp will likely fail to download on Tiger due to TLS issues. Download the files from source and uncompress to the folder you're building in.

Run the app in a folder alongside the files it builds in the process - this is a current bug that needs fixing

## Configuration

### Python Path Detection

The app automatically searches for Python 3.11 in these locations:
- `/usr/local/bin/python3.11`
- `/usr/local/bin/python3`
- `/opt/local/bin/python3.11` (MacPorts)
- `/opt/local/bin/python3`
- `python3` (system PATH)

### Bundling Resources

To include Python script and yt-dlp in your app bundle:

## Usage

### Basic Navigation

1. **Launch the app**
2. **Enter subreddit name** (e.g., "programming", "pics")
3. **Select sort order** (Hot, New, Top, Rising)
4. **Click Refresh**

### Content Types

- **üñºÔ∏è Images** - Click "View Image" to download to Desktop
- **üé• Videos** - Click "View Image" ‚Üí Choose download or browser
- **üîó Articles** - **Note: Cannot be opened directly from app - This should be fixed**
- **üí¨ Text Posts** - Click "View Image" to read content
- **üì¶ Galleries** - **Note: Only downloads first image, not entire gallery**

### Comments

1. **Select a post**
2. **Click "Comments"**
3. **View in popup window**

**‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitation:** Comments only work reliably on posts with fewer than 20 comments. Posts with more comments may fail to load or cause the app to hang.

## Known Limitations/ Bugs

### Comments System
- **Only works reliably on posts with <20 comments**
- Posts with 20+ comments may timeout or hang the app
- Large comment threads can overwhelm Tiger's memory management
- **Workaround:** Stick to smaller subreddits or newer posts with fewer comments

### Article Links  
- **Cannot open articles directly from the app**
- Article URLs are displayed but not clickable
- **Workaround:** Copy the URL manually and paste into TenFourFox or your preferred browser

### Gallery Support
- **Only downloads the first image from Reddit galleries**
- Multi-image galleries are not fully supported
- **Workaround:** Individual gallery images can be accessed by visiting the post in a browser

### General Performance
- Image downloading may be slow on PowerPC systems
- Large subreddits (r/all, r/popular) may take time to load
- Computer's limited memory may cause issues with image-heavy posts

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Python not found"**
- Install Python 3.11 using one of the methods above
- Check that `python3 --version` shows 3.11.x

**"Script not found in app bundle"**
- Ensure `reddit_fetcher.py` is in the project directory during build
- Check bundle contents: Right-click app ‚Üí Show Package Contents ‚Üí Contents/Resources
- Try rebuilding: `make clean && make`

**"Video download fails"**
- Ensure `ffmpeg` is installed and in PATH
- Check that `yt-dlp` is executable: `chmod +x yt-dlp`
- For PowerPC, may need to compile yt-dlp dependencies

**"Comments won't load"**
- **Most common cause:** Post has too many comments (20+)
- Try posts with fewer comments first
- Check Console.app for Python timeout errors
- **Solution:** None right now, would like to fix this

**"Can't open article links"**
- This is expected behavior - articles cannot be opened directly
- Copy the URL shown and paste into TenFourFox or other browser
- This needs to be fixed

**"Gallery only shows one image"**
- This is a known limitation
- Only the first gallery image downloads

## Development

### Adding Features

The app uses a hybrid architecture:
- **Objective-C frontend** - Native Tiger UI and controls
- **Python backend** - Modern HTTPS and Reddit API support

### Key Files

- `RedditViewer.m` - Main application logic
- `reddit_fetcher.py` - Reddit API interface
- `cJSON` - JSON parsing for comment data

### Tiger Compatibility Notes

- Built with Makefile and GCC 4.0 for maximum Tiger compatibility
- Uses manual memory management (no ARC)
- No blocks or modern Objective-C features
- NSTimer for async operations instead of GCD
- Universal binary support for both PowerPC and Intel Macs
